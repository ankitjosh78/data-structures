# data-structures

A repository which explains various data structures concepts. These are just my understandings of it, so feel free to correct me if you find some mistakes ðŸ˜„

  (_Note_: This is going to take __some time__, I'm doing this in my free time, so that __I can look back on these__ when I need to and __it should also help others__)
  
  (_Note_: I would be mostly using __C__ syntax over here but you can should be able to understand the concept regardless of the language.)
