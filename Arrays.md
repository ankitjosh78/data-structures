# What the heck is an array?
   Well, an array is just __a collection of similar types of data__ and each of those __data items in it is called an element of the array__. 
   
   Now, the datatype of the elements can be __any valid data type__ like _int_, _float_, _char_, _string_, _bool_.
   
   One thing to note is that: __the elements__ of an array share the __same variable name__ but has __different index__.
      
    
   ### Example:
   To store the weights of 10 of your friends, we can take an array named _wt_ of type _int_ and of size 10.
   
   In C/C++, it would look something like:
   
   _int wt_[10];  where each elements will be in order: _wt_[0],_wt_[1],....,_wt_[9]
   
   (Remember: The indexing starts from 0)
        Over here, _wt_[0] is the first element, _wt_[1] is the second element and so on.
    
  ### Now that you know what an array is, you need to know about the dimension of an array. 
    
  
  Arrays can be one dimensional as well as multidimensional. __How to tell the dimension you may ask?__ , well _"the number of subscripts"_ in an array determines it's dimension.
    
  In our example, we saw an one-dimensional array as it had only _one subscript_.
  
  A two dimensional array would be something like: __arrayName[][]__;
